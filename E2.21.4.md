In most of them we cannot [235] avoid observing their sensible Qualities, nay their very Substances to be in a continual flux: And therefore with reason we look on them as liable still to the same Change. Nor have we of active Power (which is the more proper signification of the word Power) fewer instances. Since whatever Change is observed, the Mind must collect a Power somewhere, able to make that Change, as well as a possibility in the thing it self to receive it. But yet, if we will consider it attentively, Bodies, by our Senses, do not afford us so clear and distinct an Idea of active Power, as we have from reflection on the Operations of our Minds.

> let us consider whence we have the clearest Ideas of the Powers, which produce these Actions. 1. Of Thinking, Body affords us no Idea at all, it is only from Reflection that we have that: 2. Neither have we from Body any Idea of the beginning of Motion. A Body at rest affords us no Idea of any active Power to move; and when it is set in motion it self, that Motion is rather a Passion, than an Action in it. For when the Ball obeys the stroke of a Billiardstick, it is not any action of the Ball, but bare passion: Also when by impulse it sets another Ball in motion, that lay in its way, it only communicates the motion it had received from another, and loses in it self so much, as the other received; which gives us but a very obscure Idea of an active Power of moving in Body, whilst we observe it only to transfer, but not produce any motion. For it is but a very obscure Idea of Power, which reaches not the Production of the Action, but the Continuation of the Passion. For so is motion in a Body impelled by another: The continuation of the Alteration made in it from rest to motion being little more an Action, than the continuation of the Alteration of its Figure by the same blow is an Action. The Idea of the beginning of motion, we have only from reflection on what passes in our selves, where we find by Experience, that barely by willing it, barely by a thought of the Mind, we can move the parts of our Bodies, which were before at rest. So that it seems to me, we have from the observation of the operation of Bodies by our Senses, but a very imperfect obscure Idea of active Power, since they afford us not any Idea in themselves of the Power to begin any Action, either motion or thought. But if, from the Impulse Bodies are observed to make one upon another, any one [236] thinks he has a clear Idea of Power, it serves as well to my purpose, Sensation being one of those ways, whereby the mind comes by its Ideas: Only I thought it worth while to consider here by the way, whether the mind doth not receive its Idea of active Power clearer from reflection on its own Operations, than it doth from any external Sensation.
