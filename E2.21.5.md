[[2.21 力について]]＞

> This at least I think evident, That we find in our selves a Power to begin or forbear, continue or end several actions of our minds, and motions of our Bodies, barely by a thought or preference of the mind ordering, or as it were commanding the doing or not doing such or such a particular action. This Power which the mind has, thus to order the consideration of any Idea, or the for- bearing to consider it; or to prefer the motion of any part of the body to its rest, and vice versâ in any particular instance is that which we call the Will. The actual exercise of that power, by directing any particular action, or its forbearance is that which we call Volition or Willing. The forbearance or performance of that action, consequent to such order or command of the mind is called Voluntary. And whatsoever action is performed without such a thought of the mind is called Involuntary. The power of Perception is that which we call the Understanding.

> われわれが知性の作用と考える知覚は三つの種類からなる。1、われわれの心に中の観念の知覚。2、記号の意味表示の知覚。3、われわれのいかなる観念のあいだにもある、結合と背馳、一致と不一致の知覚
> Perception, which we make the act of the Understanding, is of three sorts: 1. The Perception of *Ideas* in our Minds. 2. The Perception of the signification of Signs. 3. The Perception of the Connexion or Repugnancy, Agreement or Disagreement, that there is between any of our *Ideas*.

> All these are attributed to the *Understanding*, or perceptive Power, though it be the two latter only that use allows us to say we understand.
