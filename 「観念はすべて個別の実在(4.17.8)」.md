「観念はすべて個別の実在(4.17.8)」
 [[E4.17.8]]

 Every Man's Reasoning and Knowledge, is only about the [[/ Ideas]] existing in his own Mind, which are truly, every one of them, particular Existences: and our Knowledge and Reasoning about other Things, is only as they correspond with those our particular [[/ Ideas]].
