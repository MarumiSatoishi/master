[[2.30 実在的と空想的観念について]]＞[[単純観念]]はすべて[[実在的]]

> われわれの**単純観念はすべて実在的である**。〔…〕
> *First*, Our *simple* Ideas *are all real*, all agree to the reality of things. Not that they are all of them the Images, or Representations of what does exist, the contrary whereof, in all but the primary Qualities of Bodies, hath been already shewed. But though Whiteness and Coldness are no more in Snow, than Pain is; yet those Ideas of Whiteness, and Coldness, Pain, etc. being in us the Effects of Powers in Things without us, ordained by our Maker, to produce in us such Sensations; they are real Ideas in us, whereby we distinguish the Qualities, that are really in things themselves. For these several Appearances, being designed to be the Marks, whereby we are to know, and distinguish Things, which we have to do with; our Ideas do as well serve us to that purpose, and are as real distinguishing Characters, whether they be only constant Effects, or else exact Resemblances of something in the things themselves: 
> 実在性は、観念が実在する存在物の際立った構造とのあいだにもつ定常的対応に存している。
> the reality lying in that steady correspondence, they have with the distinct Constitutions of real Beings. 
> 
> But whether they answer to those Constitutions, as to Causes, or Patterns, it matters not; 
> 観念が不断にそれ〔実在する存在物の構造〕によって生み出されることだけで十分なのである。
> it suffices, that they are constantly produced by them. 
> 
> And thus our simple Ideas are all real and true, 
> なぜなら、単純観念は心にそれを生み出す事物の力に一致していて、それは単純観念を実在的にするのに要求されるすべてだからだ〔…〕
> because they answer and agree to those Powers of Things, which produce them in our Minds, that being all that is requisite to make them real, and not fictions at Pleasure.

> For in simple Ideas, (as has been shewn,) the Mind is wholly confined to the Operation of things upon it; and can make to it self no simple Idea, more than what it has received.
