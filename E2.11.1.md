> ANOTHER Faculty, we may take notice of in our Minds, is that of Discerning and distinguishing between the several Ideas it has. 
> 
> It is not enough to have a confused Perception of something in general: Unless the Mind had a distinct Perception of different Objects, and their Qualities, it would be capable of very little Knowledge; 
> 
> though the Bodies that affect us, were as busie about us, as they are now, and the Mind were continually employ'd in thinking.

> 
> On this faculty of Distinguishing one thing from another, depends the evidence and certainty of several, even very general Propositions, which have passed for innate Truths; 
> 
> because Men over-looking the true cause, why those Propositions find universal assent, impute it wholly to native uniform Impressions; 
> 
> whereas it in truth depends upon this clear discerning Faculty of the Mind, whereby it perceives two Ideas to be the same, or different. But of this more hereafter.
