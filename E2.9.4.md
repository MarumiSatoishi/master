 [[2.9 知覚について＞知覚は心が印象を受け取るときのみ




 

 > How often may a Man observe in himself, that whilst his Mind is intently employ'd in the contemplation of some Objects; and curiously surveying some Ideas  that are there, it takes no notice of impression of sounding Bodies, made upon the Organ of Hearing, with the same alteration, that uses to be for the producing the Idea of Sound? A sufficient impulse there may be on the Organ; but it not reaching the observation of the Mind, there follows no perception: And though the motion, that uses to preduce the Idea of Sound, be made in the Ear, yet no sound is heard. Want of Sensation in this case, is not through any defect in the Organ, or that the Man's Ears are less affected, than at other times, when he does hear: but that which uses to produce the Ideathough conveyed in by the usual Organ, not  being taken notice of in the Understanding, and so imprinting no *Idea* on the Mind, there follows no Sensation.

 > **よって、感覚、あるいは知覚があるとき、何らかの観念が実際に生み出されており、かつ知性に現前しているのである**。
 > *So that where-ever there is Sense, or Perception, there some Idea is actually produced,  and present in the Understanding.*


注意がなければ、感覚の観念が得られない
