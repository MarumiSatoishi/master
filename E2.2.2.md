> あらゆるわれわれの知識の材料である単純観念は、**感覚**と**反省**〔…〕からのみ心に示唆され、備え付けられる
> These simple *Ideas*, the Materials of all our Knowledge, are suggested and furnished to the Mind, only by those two ways above mentioned, *viz*. *Sensation* and *Reflection*. 
> 知性は〔…〕それ〔単純観念〕を繰り返し、比較し、ほとんど無限のバラエティで結合する力を持ち、それで、意のままに新しい複合**観念**を作ることができる。
> When the Understanding is once stored with these simple *Ideas*, it has the Power to repeat, compare, and unite them even to an almost infinite Variety, and so can make at Pleasure new complex *Ideas*.

> しかし、揚々たる機知も、肥大した知性も、いかなる思考の早さやバラエティをもってしても、心の中に、前述した仕方で得られない**新たな単純観念をひとつでも創出したり、形作る**ことはその力のうちにない。
> But it is not in the Power of the most exalted Wit, or enlarged Understanding, by any quickness or variety of Thought, to *invent or frame one new simple* Idea in the mind, not taken in by the ways before mentioned: 
> また、知性のどのような強制力も、そこにあるそれ〔単純観念〕を**破壊**することはできない。
> nor can any force of the Understanding, *destroy* those that are there. The Dominion of Man, in this little World of his own Understanding, being muchwhat the same, as it is in the great World of visible things; wherein his Power, however managed by Art and Skill, reaches no farther, than to compound and divide the Materials, that are made to his Hand; but can do nothing towards the making the least Particle of new Matter, or destroying one Atome of what is already in Being. The same inability, will every one find in himself, who shall go about to fashion in his Understanding any simple Idea, not received in by his Senses, from external Objects; or by reflection from the Operations of his own mind about them. I would have any one try to fancy any Taste, which had never affected his Palate; or frame the Idea of a Scent, he had never smelt: And when he can do this, I will also conclude, that a blind Man hath Ideas of Colours, and a deaf Man true distinct Notions of Sounds.
