> As to the third sort of our Knowledge, viz. *the Agreement or Disagreement of any of our* Ideas *in any other Relation*: This, as it is the largest Field of our Knowledge, so it is hard to determine how far it may extend: 
> 
> Because the Advances that are made in this part of Knowledge, depending on our Sagacity, in finding intermediate Ideas, that may shew the *Relations* and *Habitudes* of Ideas, whose Coexistence is not considered, 'tis a hard Matter to tell, when we are at an end of such Discoveries; and when Reason has all the helps it is capable of, for the finding of Proofs, or examining the Agreement or Disagreement of remote Ideas. 
> 
> They that are ignorant of Algebra cannot imagine the Wonders in this kind are to be done by it: and what farther Improvements and Helps, advantageous to other parts of Knowledge, the sagacious Mind of Man may yet find out, 'tis not easy to determine. 
> 
> This at least I believe, that the Ideas of Quantity are not those alone that are capable of Demonstration and Knowledge; and that other, and perhaps more useful parts of Contemplation, would afford us Certainty, if Vices, Passions, and domineering Interest did not oppose, or menace such Endeavours. ↩
> 
> The Idea of a supreme Being, infinite in Power, Goodness, and Wisdom, whose Workmanship we are, and on whom we depend; and the Idea of our selves, as understanding, rational Beings, being such as are clear in us, would, I suppose, if duly considered, and pursued, afford such Foundations of our Duty and Rules of Action, as might place Morality amongst the Sciences capable of Demonstration: 
> 
> wherein I doubt not, but from self-evident Propositions, by necessary Consequences, as incontestable as those in Mathematicks, the measures of right and wrong might be made out, to any one that will apply himself with the same Indifferency and Attention to the one, as he does to the other of these Sciences. 
> 数および延長の観念の〔各々の間の〕関係と同じように、ほかの**様相**の**関係**も、確実に知覚されるだろう
> The *Relation* of other *Modes* may certainly be perceived, as well as those of Number and Extension: 
> 
> and I cannot see, why they should not also be capable of Demonstration, if due Methods were thought on to examine, or pursue their Agreement or Disagreement. 
> 
> *Where there is no Property*, there is no Injustice, is a Proposition as certain as any Demonstration in Euclid: For the Idea of Property, being a right to any thing; and the Idea to which the Name Injustice is given, being the Invasion or Violation of that right; it is evident, that these Ideas being thus established, and these Names annexed to them, I can as certainly know this Proposition to be true, as that a Triangle has three Angles equal to two right ones. Again, No Government allows absolute Liberty: The Idea of Government being the establishment of Society upon certain Rules or Laws, which require Conformity to them; and the Idea of absolute Liberty being for any one to do whatever he pleases; I am as capable of being certain of the Truth of this Proposition, as of any in Mathematicks.
