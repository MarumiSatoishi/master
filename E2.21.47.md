> 私が言ったように、最大の、最も差し迫った〔落ち着かなさ〕が意志を次の行為へと決定するというのが自然ではあり、大概はそうであるが、いつもそうであるわけではないのである。
> it is natural, as I have said, that the greatest, and most pressing should determine the *will* to the next action; and so it does for the most part, but not always. 
> 
> 経験において明らか evident なように、心はほとんどの事例において、その欲望のいずれもの、そしてすべての実行と満足を、次から次へ**宙吊りにする** *suspend* 力を持ち、それで心は欲望の対象を考慮し、すべての側面から検討し、他の〔欲望の対象〕と比較衡量する自由にあるのである。
> For the mind having in most cases, as is evident in Experience, a power to *suspend* the execution and satisfaction of any of its desires, and so all, one after another, is at liberty to consider the objects of them; examine them on all sides, and weigh them with others. 
> ここに、人がもつ自由が存在する lies 。
> In this lies the liberty Man has; 
> 
> and from the not using of it right comes all that variety of mistakes, errors, and faults which we run into, in the conduct of our lives, and our endeavours after happiness; whilst we precipitate the determination of our wills, and engage too soon before due Examination. To prevent this we have a power to suspend the prosecution of this or that desire, as every one daily may Experiment in himself.

> これがすべての自由の源泉であるように、私には思われる
> ***This seems to me the source of all liberty***;

> in this seems to consist that, which is (as I think improperly) call'd *Free will*.

> 
> For during this suspension of any desire, before the will be determined to action, and the action (which follows that determination) done, we have opportunity to examine, view, and judge, of the good or evil of what we are going to do; 
> 
> and when, upon due Examination, we have judg'd, we have done our duty, all that we can, or ought to do, in pursuit of our happiness; 
> 
> 公正な検討の最終結果に従って欲望し、意志し、行為することは、われわれの本性を損なうことではなく、むしろ**完成させること** a perfection of our nature なのである。
> and 'tis not a fault, but ***a perfection of our nature*** to desire, will, and act according to the last result of a fair *Examination*.
