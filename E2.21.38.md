For all absent good, by which alone barely propos'd, and coming in view, the will is thought to be determin'd, and so to set us on action, being only possible, but not infallibly certain, 'tis unavoidable, that the infinitely greater possible good should regularly and constantly determine the will in all the successive actions it directs; and then we should keep constantly and steadily in our course towards Heaven, without ever standing still, or directing our actions to any other end: The eternal condition of a future state infinitely out-weighing the Expectation of Riches, or Honour, or any other worldly pleasure, which we can propose to our selves, though we should grant these the more probable to be attain'd:

> For nothing future is yet in possession, and so the expectation even of these may deceive us. If it were so, that the greater good in view determines the will, so great a good once propos'd could not but seize the will, and hold it fast to the pursuit of this infinitely greatest good, without ever letting it go again:

> For the will having a power over, and directing the thoughts, as well as other actions, would, if it were so, hold the contemplation of the mind fixed to that good. ↩

> This would be the state of the mind, and regular tendency of the will in all its determinations, were it determin'd by that, which is consider'd, and in view the greater good; but that it is not so is visible in Experience.

> The infinitely greatest confessed good being often neglected, to satisfy the successive uneasiness of our desires pursuing trifles.

> But though the greatest allowed, even everlasting unspeakable good, which has sometimes moved, and affected the mind, does not stedfastly hold the will,

> こうして、身体のどんな激しい痛み、暴力的に愛のうちにある人の統御できない情念、あるいは、耐えられない復讐の欲望、これらは意志を定まった、専心するものにとどめ続ける。そして、このように決定された意志は決して知性をしてその目的をやめさせない。それどころか、すべての心の思考と身体の力が、その抜きん出た**落ち着かなさ**に影響された**意志**の決定によって、妨げられることなく、その方向へ従事する。その落ち着かなさが続く限り。
> Man violently in love; or the impatient desire of revenge, keeps the will steady and intent; and the will thus determined never lets the Understanding lay by the object, but all the thoughts of the Mind, and powers of the Body are uninterruptedly employ'd that way, by the determinations of the will, influenced by that topping *uneasiness*, as long as it lasts;

> whereby it seems to me evident, that the will, or power of setting us upon one action in preference to all other, is determin'd in us, by uneasiness: and whether this be not so, I desire every one to observe in himself
