> To return then to the Enquiry, what is it that determines the Will in regard to our Actions? And that upon second thoughts I am apt to imagine is not, as is generally supposed, the greater good in view: 
> 
> 人が現前においてそのもとにいる（往々にしてもっとも差し迫った）**落ち着かなさ**である。
> But some (and for the most part the most pressing) *uneasiness* a Man is at present under. 
> 
> This is that which successively determines the Will, and sets us upon those Actions, we perform. This *Uneasiness* we may call, as it is, *Desire*; 
> 
> 心がなんらかの非現前の善 absent good の欠如に対して持つ
> which is an uneasiness of the Mind for want of some absent good. 
> 
> All pain of the body of what sort soever, and disquiet of the mind, is uneasiness: And with this is always join'd Desire, equal to the pain or uneasiness felt; and is scarce distinguishable from it. 
> というのも、**欲望**は他でもない非現前の善の欠如に対する**落ち着かなさ**であるが、〔…〕その〔感じられている苦痛の〕和らぎ ease が得られるまでは、われわれは、これを**欲望**と呼んでよいだろう。
> For *desire* being nothing but an *uneasiness* in the want of an absent good, in reference to any pain felt, ease is that absent good; and till that ease be attained, we may call it *desire*, 
> 
> no body feeling pain, that he wishes not to be eased of, with a desire equal to that pain, and inseparable from it.  
> 〔…〕他に、非現前の肯定的な善というものもあり、ここでも、欲望と**落ち着かなさ**は等しい。われわれがなんらかの非現前の善を欲するほど、それを求める苦のうちにいることになる。
> Besides this desire of ease from pain, there is another of absent positive good, and here also the desire and *uneasiness* is equal. As much as we desire any absent good, so much are we in pain for it. 
> 
> But here all absent good does not, according to the greatness it has, or is acknowledg'd to have, cause pain equal to that greatness; as all pain causes desire equal to it self: 
> 
> なぜなら、非現前の善はつねに苦であるというわけではない〔…〕
> Because the absence of good is not always a pain, as the presence of pain is. 
> よって、非現前の善は**欲望**なしに見られ、考慮されることができる。
> And therefore absent good may be looked on, and considered without *desire*. 
> 
> But so much as there is any where of desire, so much there is of uneasiness.
