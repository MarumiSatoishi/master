[[2.2 単純観念について]]＞[[非混合的]]な[[顕れ]]



> 
> THE better to understand the Nature, Manner, and Extent of our Knowledge, one thing is carefully to be observed, concerning the Ideas we have; and that is, That some of them are simple, and some complex. 
> 
> Though the Qualities that affect our Senses, are, in the things themselves, so united and blended, that there is no separation, no distance between them; 
> 
> yet 'tis plain, the Ideas they produce in the Mind, enter by the Senses simple and unmixed. 
> 
> For though the Sight and Touch often take in from the same Object, at the same time, different *Ideas*; as a Man sees at once Motion and Colour; the Hand feels Softness and Warmth in the same piece of Wax: 
> 
> Yet the simple *Ideas* thus united in the same Subject, are as perfectly distinct, as those that come in by different Senses. 
> 
> 
> The coldness and hardness, which a Man feels in a piece of Ice, being as distinct Ideas in the Mind, as the Smell and Whiteness of a Lily; or as the taste of Sugar, and smell of a Rose: 
> 
> And there is nothing can be plainer to a Man, than the clear and distinct Perception he has of those simple Ideas; 
> それは各々、それ自体において非合成的であり、そのうちに、**ひとつの一様な顕れ**  *one uniform Appearance* 、すなわち、心における把握以外のなにものも含まない。そして、べつの諸観念に区別不可能である。
> which being each in it self uncompounded, contains in it nothing but *one uniform Appearance*, or Conception in the mind, and is not distinguishable into different *Ideas*.
