> Another reason why 'tis uneasiness alone determines the will, may be this. 
> なぜなら、落ち着かなさだけが現前し、現前していないものが、それがないところではたらくなどということは、事物の本性に反するからである。
> Because that alone is present, and 'tis against the nature of things, that what is absent should operate, where it is not.

> It may be said, that absent good may by contemplation be brought home to the mind, and made present. The Idea of it indeed may be in the mind, and view'd as present there: but nothing will be in the mind as a present good, able to counter-balance the removal of any uneasiness, which we are under, till it raises our desire, and the uneasiness of that has the prevalency in determining the will. Till then the Idea in the mind of whatever good, is there only like other Ideas, the object of bare unactive speculation; but operates not on the will, nor sets us on work: the reason whereof I shall shew by and by. How many are to be found, that have had lively representations set before their minds of the unspeakable joys of Heaven, which they acknowledge both possible and probable too, who yet would be content to take up with their happiness here? and so the prevailing uneasinesses of their desires, let loose after the enjoyments of this life, take their turns in the determining their wills, and all that while they take not one step, are not one jot moved, towards the good things of another life considered as never so great.
