「主に観念と語が記号に使われる(2.32.19)」

ということは…
[[観念、語以外の記号もありえる]]

For Truth, or Falshood, being never without some Affirmation, or Negation, Express, or Tacit, it is not to be found, but where signs are joined or separated, according to the agreement, or disagreement, of the Things they stand for. The signs we chiefly use, are either Ideas, or Words, wherewith we make either mental, or verbal Propositions. Truth lies in so joining, or separating these Representatives, as the Things they stand for, do, in themselves, agree, or disagree: and Falshood in the contrary, as shall be more fully shewed hereafter.
