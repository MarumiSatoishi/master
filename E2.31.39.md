> I have hitherto chiefly instanced in the uneasiness of desire, as that which determines the will. Because that is the chief, and 30 most sensible; and the will seldom orders any action, nor is there any voluntary action performed, without some desire accompanying it; which I think is the reason why the will and desire are so often confounded. But yet we are not to look upon the uneasiness which makes up, or at least accompanies most of the other Passions, as wholly excluded in the case. Aversion, Fear, Anger, Envy, Shame, etc. have each their uneasiness too, and thereby influence the will. These Passions are scarce any of them in life and practice, simple, and alone, and wholly unmixed with others; though usually in discourse and contemplation, that carries the name, which operates strongest, and appears most in the present state of the mind. Nay there is, I think, scarce any of the Passions to be found without desire join'd with it. I am sure, where-ever there is uneasiness there is desire: For we constantly desire happiness; and whatever we feel of uneasiness, so much, 'tis certain, we want of happiness; even in our own Opinion, let our state and condition otherwise be what it will.

> Besides, the present moment not being our eternity, whatever our enjoyment be, we look beyond the present, and desire goes with our foresight, and that still carries the will with it.

> So that even in joy it self, that which keeps up the action, whereon the enjoyment depends, is the desire to continue it, and fear to lose it: And whenever a greater uneasiness than that takes place in the mind, the will presently is by that determin'd to some new action, and the present delight neglected.
