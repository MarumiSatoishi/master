> *Power* thus considered is twofold, *viz*. as able to make, or able to receive any change: The one may be called *Active*, and the other *Passive Power*. 
> 
> Whether Matter be not wholly destitute of active Power, as its Author GOD is truly above all passive Power; and whether the intermediate state of created Spirits be not that alone, which is capable of both active and passive Power, may be worth  consideration. I shall not now enter into that Enquiry, my present Business being not to search into the original of Power, but how we come by the Idea of it. But since active Powers make so great a part of our complex Ideas of natural Substances, (as we shall see hereafter,) and I mention them as such, according to common apprehension; yet they being not, perhaps, so truly active Powers, as our hasty Thoughts are apt to represent them, I judge it not amiss, by this intimation, to direct our Minds to the consideration of GOD and Spirits, for the clearest Idea of active Power.
