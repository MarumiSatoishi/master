> Thus we say, Fire has a power to melt Gold, i.e. to destroy the consistency of its insensible parts, and consequently its hardness, and make it fluid; and Gold has a power to be melted; That the Sun has a power to blanch Wax, and Wax a power to be blanched by the Sun, whereby the Yellowness is destroy'd, and Whiteness made to exist in its room. In which, and the like Cases, the Power we consider is in reference to the change of perceivable Ideas. For we cannot observe any alteration to be made in, or operation upon any thing, but by the observable change of its sensible Ideas; nor conceive any alteration to be made, but by conceiving a Change of some of its Ideas.
