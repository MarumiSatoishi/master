「感覚から実際に来ている観念と記憶から復活している観念との違いは明らか(4.2.14)」

 But whether ther be any thing more than barely that [[Idea]] in our Minds, whether we can thence certainly inferr the existence of any thing without us, which corresponds to that [[Idea]], is that, whereof some Men think may be a question made, because Men may have such Ideas in their Minds, when no such Thing exists, no such Object affects their Senses. But yet here, I think, we are provided with an Evidence, that puts us past doubting: For I ask any one, Whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different Perception, when he looks on the Sun by day, and thinks on it by night; when he actually tastes Wormwood, or smells a Rose, or only thinks on that Savour, or Odour? We as plainly find the difference there is between any [[Idea]] revived in our Minds by our own Memory, and actually coming into our  Minds by our Senses, as we do between any two distinct [[Ideas]].
