> これ〔公正な検討の最終結果に従って欲望、意志、行為すること〕は、自由の束縛や減少では全くなく、むしろ、自由のまさに発展であり、その利益なのである。
> This is so far from being a restraint or diminution of *Freedom*, that it is the very improvement and benefit of it: 
> 〔…〕それはわれわれの**自由**の目的でありかつ有用性である〔…〕
> 'tis not an Abridgment, 'tis the end and use of our *Liberty*; and the farther we are removed from such a determination, the nearer we are to Misery and Slavery. 
> 
> A perfect Indifferency in the Mind, not determinable by its last judgment of the Good or Evil, that is thought to attend its Choice, would be so far from being an advantage and excellency of any intellectual Nature, that it would be as great an imperfection, as the want of Indifferency to act, or not to act, till determined by the Will, would be an imperfection on the other side. 
> 
> A Man is at liberty to lift up his Hand to his Head, or let it rest quiet: He is perfectly indifferent in either; and it would be an imperfection in him, if he wanted that Power, if he were deprived of that Indifferency. 
> 
> %%なぐられるのを避ける必然性が自由であるの例%%
> But it would be as great an imperfection, if he had the same indifferency, whether he would prefer the lifting up his Hand, or its remaining in rest, when it would save his Head or Eyes from a blow he sees coming: 
> 
> 'tis as much a perfection, that desire or the power of Preferring should be determined by Good, as that the power of Acting should be determined by the Will, and the certainer such determination is, the greater is the perfection. 
> 
> Nay were we determined by any thing but the last result of our own Minds, judging of the good or evil of any action, we were not free, the very end of our Freedom being, that we might attain the good we chuse. 
> すべての人はその知的存在者としての構造 constitution によって、なにが自分にとって最善かという自身の思考と判断によって、意志を決定する必然性のもとに置かれているのである。
> And therefore every Man is put under a necessity by his ***constitution***, as an intelligent Being, to be determined in willing by his own Thought and Judgment, what is best for him to do: 
> そうでなく、ひとが自身以外の何者かの決定のもとにあることは、自由の欠如である。
> else he would be under the determination of some other than himself, which is want of *Liberty*. 
> 
> 
> And to deny, that a Man's will, in every determination, follows his own Judgment, is to say, that a Man wills and acts for an end that he would not have at the time that he wills and acts for it. 
> 
> For if he prefers it in his present Thoughts before any other, 'tis plain he then thinks better of it, and would have it before any other, unless he can have, and not have it; will and not will it at the same time; a Contradiction too manifest to be admitted.
