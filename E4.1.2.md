[[4.1 知識一般について]]＞

> こうして、**知識**は私には**われわれのなんらかの観念の結合と一致、または不一致と背馳の知覚**以外のなにものでもないように思われる。これにのみ、それ〔知識〕は存するのである。
> *Knowledge* then seems to me to be nothing but *the perception of the connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas*. In this alone it consists. 
> 
> Where this Perception is, there is Knowledge, and where it is not, there, though we may fancy, guess, or believe, yet we always come short of Knowledge. For when we know that White is not Black, what do we else but perceive, that these two Ideas do not agree? When we possess our selves with the utmost security of the Demonstration, that the three Angles of a Triangle are equal to two right ones, What do we more but perceive, that Equality to two right ones, does necessarily agree to, and is inseparable from the three Angles of a Triangle?
