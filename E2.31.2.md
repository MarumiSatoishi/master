[[2.31 十全な観念と非十全な観念について]]＞[[全単純観念は十全]]

> **単純観念はすべて十全である**
> First, That *all our simple* Ideas *are adequate*. 
> なぜなら、〔単純観念は〕神によってわれわれにこれこれの感覚を生み出すように合わせられ、定められた、事物のうちにある力の結果以外のなにものでもないため、単純観念は、それらの力に一致し、十全でないわけにはいかないのからである。そして、われわれは単純観念が事物の実在性 reality に一致していると確信する。
> Because being nothing but the effects of certain Powers in Things, fitted and ordained by GOD, to produce such Sensations in us, they cannot but be correspondent, and adequate to those Powers: And we are sure they agree to the reality of Things. 
> 
> For if Sugar produce in us the Ideas, which we call Whiteness, and Sweetness, we are sure there is a power in Sugar to produce those Ideas in our Minds, or else they could not have been produced by it. And so each Sensation answering the Power, that operates on any of our Senses, the Idea so produced, is a real Idea, (and not a fiction of the Mind, which has no power to produce any simple Idea;) and cannot but be adequate, since it ought only to answer that power: and so all simple Ideas are adequate. 'Tis true, the Things producing in us these simple Ideas, are but few of them denominated by us, as if they were only the causes of them; but as if those Ideas were real Beings in them. For though Fire be call'd painful to the Touch, whereby is signified the power of producing in us the Idea of Pain; yet it is denominated also Light, and Hot; as if Light and Heat, were really something in the Fire, more than a power to excite these Ideas in us; and therefore are called Qualities in, or of the Fire. But these being nothing, in truth, but powers to excite such Ideas in us, I must, in that sense, be understood, when I speak of secondary Qualities, as being in Things; or of their Ideas, as being in the Objects, that excite them in us. Such ways of speaking, though accommodated to the vulgar Notions, without which, one cannot be well understood; yet truly signify nothing, but those Powers, which are in Things, to excite certain Sensations or Ideas in us. Since were there no fit Organs to receive the impressions Fire makes on the Sight and Touch; nor a Mind joined to those Organs to receive the Ideas of Light and Heat, by those impressions from the Fire, or the Sun, there would yet be no more Light, or Heat in the World, than there would be Pain if there were no sensible Creature to feel it, though the Sun should continue just as it is now, and Mount Ætna flame higher than ever it did. Solidity, and Extension, and the termination of it, Figure, with Motion and Rest,whereof we have the Ideas, would be really in the World as they are, whether there were any sensible Being to perceive them, or no: And therefore those we have reason to look on, as the real modifications of Matter; and such as are the exciting Causes of all our various Sensations from Bodies. But this being an Enquiry not belonging to this place, I shall enter no farther into it, but proceed to shew, what complex Ideas are adequate, and what not.
