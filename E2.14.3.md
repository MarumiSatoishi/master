> 自分じしんの心を過ぎゆくものを観察だけでもする人には、彼が覚醒しているかぎり、そこには観念のひとつの系列があり、それは次々と彼の知性の中にたえず継起することは明白 evident である。
> 'Tis evident to any one who will but observe what passes in his own Mind, that there is a train of Ideas, which constantly succeed one another in his Understanding, as long as he is awake.

> *Reflection* on these appearances of several *Ideas* one after another in our Minds, is that which furnishes us with the Idea of Succession:

> And the distance between any parts of that Succession, or between the appearance of any two Ideas in our Minds, is that we call Duration.
