[[1.1 イントロダクション]]＞[[観念]]が表すもの

Thus much I thought necessary to say concerning the Occasion of this Enquiry into humane Understanding. 

しかし、この主題について私が考えていることに移る前に〔…〕**観念**という語を頻繁に用いることについて〔…〕。
But, before I proceed on to what I have thought on this Subject, I must here in the Entrance beg pardon of my Reader, for the frequent use of the Word *Idea*, which he will find in the following Treatise. 

思うに、これは[[人間]]が[[思考]]するときに[[知性]]の[[対象]]となるすべてのものを表すのにもっとも良く資するので、私はこれを**幻想、想念、形象**という表現で意図されるすべてのもの、すなわち心が思考するさいに[[従事]]しうるすべてのものを表現するために用いた。
It being that Term, which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the Object of the Understanding when a Man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by *Phantasm, Notion, Species*, or whatever it is, which the Mind can be employ'd about in thinking; and I could not avoid frequently using it. 

I presume it will be easily granted me, that there are such Ideas in Men's Minds; every one is conscious of them in himself, and Men's Words and Actions will satisfy him, that they are in others. 

Our first Enquiry then shall be, how they come into the Mind.
