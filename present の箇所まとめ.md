[[E2.21.37]]:254-5
 > Another reason why 'tis uneasiness alone determines the will,  
 > may be this. Because that alone is ***present***, and 'tis against the nature of things, that what is absent should operate, where it is not. It  
 > may be said, that absent good may by contemplation be brought home to the mind, and made ***present***. The Idea of it indeed may be in the mind, and view'd as ***present*** there: but nothing will be in the mind as a ***present*** good, able to counter-balance the removal of any uneasiness, which we are under, till it raises our desire, and the uneasiness of that has the prevalency in determining the will.

[[E2.21.39]]
 > Aversion, Fear, Anger, Envy, Shame, etc. have each their uneasiness too, and thereby influence the will. These Passions are scarce any of them in life and practice, simple, and alone, and wholly unmixed with others; though usually in discourse and contemplation, that carries the name, which operates strongest, and appears most in the ***present*** state of the mind. Nay there is, I think, scarce any of the Passions to be found without desire join'd with it. I am sure, where-ever there is uneasiness there is desire: For we constantly desire happiness; and whatever we feel of uneasiness, so much, 'tis certain, we want of happiness; even in our own Opinion, let our state and condition otherwise be what it will. Besides, the ***present*** moment not being our eternity, whatever our enjoyment be, we look beyond the ***present***, and desire goes with our foresight, and that still carries the will with it. So that even in joy it self, that which keeps up the action, whereon the enjoyment depends, is the desire to continue it, and fear to lose it: And when-ever a greater uneasiness than that takes place in the mind, the will ***present***ly is by that determin'd to some new action, and the ***present*** delight neglected.

[[E2.21.40]]
 > But these set apart, the most important and urgent uneasiness, we at that time feel, is that, which ordinarily determines the will successively, in that train of voluntary actions, which make up our lives. The greatest ***present*** uneasiness is the spur to action, that is constantly felt; and for the most part determines the will in its choice of the next action. For this we must carry along with us,
 > that the proper and only object of the will is some action of ours, and nothing else.

[[E2.21.42]]
 > And the lowest degree of what can be called Happiness, is so much ease from all Pain, and so much ***present*** Pleasure, as without which any one cannot be content

[[E2.21.43]]
 > All other good however great in reality, or appearance, excites not a Man's desires, who looks not on it to make a part of that happiness, wherewith he, in his ***present*** thoughts, can satisfie himself. Happiness, under this view, every one constantly pursues, and desires what makes any part of it:[...]
 > 
 > But yet as soon as the studious Man's hunger and thirst makes him uneasie, he whose will was never determined to any pursuit of good chear, poinant Sauces, or delicious Wine by the pleasant tast he has found in them, is, by the uneasiness of Hunger and Thirst, ***present***ly determined to Eating and Drinking; t

> All ***present*** pain, whatever it be, makes a part of our ***present*** misery: But all absent good does not at any time make a necessary part of our ***present*** happiness, nor the absence of it make a part of our misery. If it did, we should be constantly and infinitely miserable; there being infinite degrees of happiness, which are not in our possession. All uneasiness therefore being removed, a moderate portion of good serves at ***present*** to content Men; and some few degrees of Pleasure in a succession of ordinary Enjoyments make up a happiness, wherein they can be satisfied.

[[E2.21.45]]
 > For the removing of the pains we feel, and are at ***present*** pressed with, being the getting out of misery, and consequently the first thing  
 > to be done in order to happiness, absent good, though thought on, confessed, and appearing to be good, not making any part of this unhappiness in its absence, is jostled out, to make way for the removal of those uneasinesses we feel, till due, and repeated Contemplation has brought it nearer to our Mind, given some relish of it,  
 > and raised in us some desire; which then beginning to make a part  
 > of our ***present*** uneasiness, stands upon fair terms with the rest, to be satisfied, and so according to its greatness, and pressure, comes in its turn to determine the will.

[[E2.21.48]]
 > And to deny, that a Man's will, in every determination, follows his own Judgment, is to say, that a Man wills and acts for an end that he would not have at the time that he wills and acts for it. For if he prefers it in his ***present*** Thoughts before any other, 'tis plain he then thinks better of it, and would have it before any other, unless he can have, and not have it; will and not will it at the same time; a Contradiction too manifest to be admitted.

 > What follows after that, follows in a chain of Consequences linked one to another, all depending on the last determination of the Judgment, which whether it shall be upon an hasty and precipitate view, or upon a due and mature Examination, is in our power; Experience shewing us, that in most cases we are able to suspend the ***present*** satisfaction of any desire.

[[E2.21.57]]:271

1. Some of them come from causes not in our power, such as are 30 often the pains of the Body from want, disease, or outward injuries,

as the rack, etc. which when present, and violent, operate for the most part forcibly on the will, and turn the courses of Men's lives

........................................................................................................................... pg 272

from Virtue, Piety, and Religion, and what before they judged to lead to happiness; every one not endeavouring, or through disuse, not being able by the contemplation of remote, and future good, to


[[E2.21.58]]:272
In the first place, I shall consider the wrong judgments Men  
make of future Good and Evil, whereby their desires are misled. For as to present Happiness and Misery, when that alone comes in

20 consideration, and the consequences are quite removed, a Man never chuses amiss; he knows what best pleases him, and that, he actually prefers. Things in their present enjoyment are what they seem; the apparent and real good are, in this case, always the same. For the Pain or Pleasure being just so great, and no greater, than it

25 is felt, the present Good or Evil is really so much as it appears. And therefore were every Action of ours concluded within it self, and drew no Consequences after it, we should undoubtedly never err in our choice of good; we should always infallibly prefer the best. Were the pains of honest Industry, and of starving with Hunger

30 and Cold set together before us, no Body would be in doubt which to chuse: were the satisfaction of a Lust, and the Joys of Heaven

........................................................................................................................... pg 273

offered at once to any one's present Possession, he would not balance, or err in the determination of his choice.


[[E2.21.59]]:273 #Low
But since our voluntary Actions carry not all the Happiness  
and Misery, that depend on them, along with them in their present

5 performance; but are the precedent Causes of Good and Evil, which they draw after them, and bring upon us, when they themselves are passed, and cease to be; our desires look beyond our present enjoy- ments, and carry the Mind out to absent good, according to the necessity which we think there is of it, to the making or increase of

10 our Happiness. 'Tis our opinion of such a necessity that gives it its attraction: without that we are not moved by absent good. For in this narrow scantling of capacity, which we are accustomed to, and sensible of here, wherein we enjoy but one pleasure at once, which, when all uneasiness is away, is, whilst it lasts, sufficient to make us

15 think our selves happy, 'tis not all remote, and even apparent good, that affects us. Because the indolency and enjoyment we have, sufficing for our present Happiness, we desire not to venture the change: Since we judge that we are happy already, being content, and that is enough. For who is content is happy. But as soon as any

20 new uneasiness comes in, this Happiness is disturb'd, and we are set afresh on work in the pursuit of Happiness.

[[E2.21.61]]:274
Secondly, But because not only present Pleasure and Pain, but that also which is apt by its efficacy, or consequences, to bring it upon us at a distance, is a proper Object of our desires, and apt to move a

25 Creature, that has foresight; therefore things also that draw after them Pleasure and Pain, are considered as Good and Evil.

[[E2.21.63]]:275-6
I. Therefore, as to present Pleasure and Pain, the Mind, as  
has been said, never mistakes that which is really good or evil; that, which is the greater Pleasure, or the greater Pain, is really just as it appears. But though present Pleasure and Pain shew their difference and degrees so plainly, as not to leave room for mistake; yet when

15 we compare present Pleasure or Pain with future, (which is usually the case in the most important determinations of the Will) we often make wrong Judgments of them, taking our measures of them in different positions of distance. Objects, near our view, are apt to be thought greater, than those of a larger size, that are more remote: And so it

20 is with Pleasures and Pains, the present is apt to carry it, and those at a distance have the disadvantage in the Comparison. Thus most Men, like spend-thrift Heirs, are apt to judge a little in Hand  
better than a great deal to come; and so for small Matters in Possession, part with great ones in Reversion. But that this is a

25 wrong Judgment every one must allow, let his Pleasure consist in whatever it will: since that which is future, will certainly come to be present; and then, having the same advantage of nearness, will shew it self in its full dimensions, and discover his wilful mistake, who judged of it by unequal measures. Were the Pleasure of

30 Drinking accompanied, the very moment a Man takes off his Glass, with that sick Stomack, and aking Head, which, in some Men, are sure to follow not many hours after, I think no body, whatever Pleasure he had in his Cups, would, on these Conditions, ever let Wine touch his Lips; which yet he daily swallows, and the evil side

........................................................................................................................... pg 276

comes to be chosen only by the fallacy of a little difference in time. But if Pleasure or Pain can be so lessened only by a few hours removal, how much more will it be so, by a farther distance, to a Man, that  
will not by a right judgment do what time will, i.e. bring it home

5 upon himself, and consider it as present, and there take its true dimensions? This is the way we usually impose on our selves, in respect of bare Pleasure and Pain, or the true degrees of Happiness or Misery: The future loses its just proportion, and what is present, obtains the preference as the greater. I mention not here the wrong

10 Judgment, whereby the absent are not only lessened, but reduced to perfect nothing; when Men enjoy what they can in present,  
and make sure of that, concluding amiss, That no evil will thence follow.


[[E2.21.64]]:276-7
The cause of our judging amiss, when we compare our present

Pleasure or Pain with future, seems to me to be the weak and narrow 20 Constitution of our Minds. We cannot well enjoy two Pleasures at

once, much less any Pleasure almost, whilst Pain possesses us. The present Pleasure, if it be not very languid, and almost none at all, fills our narrow Souls, and so takes up the whole Mind, that it scarce leaves any thought of things absent: Or if among our

25 Pleasures there are some, which are not strong enough, to exclude the consideration of things at a distance; yet we have so great an abhorrence of Pain, that a little of it extinguishes all our Pleasures: A little bitter mingled in our Cup, leaves no relish of the sweet. Hence it comes, that, at any rate, we desire to be rid of the present

30 Evil, which we are apt to think nothing absent can equal; because under the present Pain we find not our selves capable of any the least degree of Happiness. Mens daily complaints are a loud proof

........................................................................................................................... pg 277

of this: The Pain that any one actually feels, is still of all other the worst; and 'tis with anguish they cry out, Any rather than this; nothing can be so intolerable as what I now suffer. And therefore our whole Endeavours and Thoughts are intent, to get rid of the

5 present Evil, before all things, as the first necessary condition to our Happiness, let what will follow. Nothing, as we passionately think, can exceed, or almost equal, the uneasiness that sits so heavy upon us. And because the abstinence from a present Pleasure, that offers it self, is a Pain, nay, oftentimes a very great one, the desire being

10 inflamed by a near and tempting Object; 'tis no wonder that that operates after the same manner Pain does, and lessens in our Thoughts, what is future; and so forces us, as it were, blindfold into its embraces.

[[E2.21.65]]:277 #High ?

Add to this, that absent good, or which is the same thing,  
15 future pleasure, especially if of a sort which we are unacquainted with, seldom is able to counter-balance any uneasiness, either of

pain or desire, which is present. For its greatness being no more, than what shall be really tasted when enjoyed, Men are apt enough to lessen that, to make it give place to any present desire; and

20 conclude with themselves, that when it comes to trial, it may possibly not answer the report, or opinion, that generally passes  
of it, they having often found, that not only what others have magnified, but even what they themselves have enjoyed with great pleasure and delight at one time, has proved insipid or nauseous at

25 another; and therefore they see nothing in it, for which they should forego a present enjoyment. But that this is a false way of judging, when apply'd to the Happiness of another life, they must confess, unless they will say, God cannot make those happy he designs to be so. For that being intended for a State of Happiness, it must

30 certainly be agreeable to every one's wish and desire: Could we suppose their relishes as different there as they are here, yet the Manna in Heaven will suit every one's Palate. Thus much of the wrong Judgment we make of present and future Pleasure and Pain, when they are compared together, and so the absent considered as

35 future.

[[E2.21.67]]:278
II. Inadvertency: When a Man overlooks even that, which he does know. This is an affected and present Ignorance, which misleads  
our Judgments, as much as the other. Judging is, as it were, balan- cing an account, and determining on which side the odds lies. If therefore either side be hudled up in haste, and several of the Sums,

25 that should have gone into the reckoning, be overlook'd, and left out, this Precipitancy causes as wrong a Judgment, as if it were a perfect Ignorance. That which most commonly causes this, is the prevalency of some present Pleasure or Pain, heightned by our feeble passionate Nature, most strongly wrought on by what

30 is present.

[[E2.21.71]]:283
Wherein lighting upon a very easy, and scarce observable slip I had made, in putting

30 one seemingly indifferent word for another, that discovery open'd to me this present view, which here in this second Edition, I sub- mit to the learned World, and which in short is this: Liberty is a power to act or not to act according as the Mind directs. A power to direct the operative faculties to motion or rest in particular in-

35 stances, is that which we call the Will. That which in the train of

........................................................................................................................... pg 283

our voluntary actions determines the Will to any change of opera- tion, is some present uneasiness, which is, or at least is always accompanied with that of Desire.[...]


My Will determines that operative Power to rest, I am yet free, because the indifferency of that my operative Power to act, or not to act, still remains; the Power of moving my Hand, is not at all impair'd by the determination of my Will, which at present orders

10 rest; the indifferency of that Power to act, or not to act, is just as it was before, as will appear, if the Will puts it to the trial, by order- ing the contrary.

Thus it is always as to our present Sensations and Perceptions: And by this every one is to himself, that which he calls *self*: It not being considered in this case, whether the same *self* be continued in the same, or divers Substances. For since consciousness always accompanies thinking, and 'tis that, that makes every one to be, what he calls *self*; and thereby distinguishes himself from all other thinking things, in this alone consists *personal Identity, i.e.* the sameness of a rational Being: And as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the Identity of that *Person*;

But next, as to the first part of the Question, Whether if the

same thinking Substance (supposing immaterial Substances only to 30 think) be changed, it can be the same Person. I answer, that cannot

be resolv'd, but by those, who know what kind of Substances they are, that do think; and whether the consciousness of past Actions can be transferr'd from one thinking Substance to another. I grant, were the same Consciousness the same individual Action, it could

35 not: But it being but a present representation of a past Action, why it may not be possible, that that may be represented to the Mind to have been, which really never was, will remain to be shewn. And

........................................................................................................................... pg 338

therefore how far the consciousness of past Actions is annexed to any individual Agent, so that another cannot possibly have it, will be hard for us to determine,


[[E2.27.24]]:345 #High 
In like manner it will be in reference to any immaterial Substance, which is void of that consciousness whereby I am my self to my self: If there be any part of its Existence, which I cannot upon recollection join with that present consciousness, whereby

I am now my self, it is in that part of its Existence no more my self, 20 than any other immaterial Being.

[[E2.27.25]]
Any Substance vitally united to the present thinking Being, is a part of that very same self which now is: Any thing united to it by a consciousness of former Actions makes also a part of the same self, which is the same both then and now.

[[E2.27.26]]
This personality extends it self beyond present Existence to what is past, only by consciousness, whereby it

30 becomes concerned and accountable, owns and imputes to it self past Actions, just upon the same ground, and for the same reason, that it does the present. All which is founded in a concern for Happiness the unavoidable concomitant of consciousness, that which is conscious of Pleasure and Pain, desiring, that that self, that

35 is conscious, should be happy. And therefore whatever past Actions it cannot reconcile or appropriate to that present self by consciousness, it can be no more concerned in, than if they had never been done: And to receive Pleasure or Pain

> 'Tis true, every Substance that exists, has its peculiar Constitution, whereon depend those sensible Qualities, and Powers, we observe in it: But the ranking of Things into Species, which is nothing but sorting them under several Titles, is done by us, according to the Ideas that we have of them: Which tho' sufficient to distinguish them by Names; so that we may be able to discourse of them, when we have them not ***present*** before us: yet if we suppose it to be done by their real internal Constitutions, and that Things existing are distinguished by Nature into Species, by real Essences, according as we distinguish them into Species by Names, we shall be liable to great Mistakes.

[[E3.11.7]]:511
 > Were they agreed in the Signification of these two Names, it were impossible they should dispute about them. For they would ***present***ly and clearly see, (were that adjusted between them,) whether all the simple Ideas, of the more general name Bird, were found in the complex Idea of a Bat, or no; and so there could be no doubt, whether a Bat were a Bird, or no.

 > There are several ways wherein the Mind is possessed of Truth; each of which is called Knowledge.
> 1. There is actual Knowledge, which is the ***present*** view the Mind has of the Agreement, or Disagreement of any of its Ideas, or of the Relation they have one to another.

[[E4.1.9]]:529

> actuall For Example in this Proposition, that the three Angles of a Triangle are equal to two right ones, one, who has seen and clearly perceived the Demonstration of this Truth, knows it to be true, when that Demonstration is gone out of his Mind; so that at present it is not ***actually*** in view, and possibly cannot be recollected: But he knows it in a different way, from what he did before.

[[E4.2.1]]:531
 > This part of Knowledge is irresistible, and like the bright Sun-shine, forces it self immediately to be perceived, as soon as ever the Mind turns its view that way; and leaves no room for Hesitation, Doubt, or Examination, but the Mind is ***present***ly filled with the clear Light of it. 'Tis on this Intuition, that depends all the Certainty and Evidence of all our Knowledge

[[E4.2.2]]:532
 > The Reason why the Mind cannot always perceive ***present***ly the Agreement or Disagreement of two Ideas is, because those Ideas, concerning whose Agreement or Disagreement the Enquiry is made, cannot by the Mind be so put together, as to shew it. I

 > Fifthly, Sensitive Knowledge reaching no farther than the Existence of Things actually ***present*** to our Senses, is yet much 30 narrower than either of the former.

[[E4.3.8]]:544
 > First, As to identity and Diversity, in this way of the Agreement, or Disagreement of our Ideas,our intuitive Knowledge is as far extended as our Ideas themselves: and there can be no Idea in the Mind, which it does not ***present***ly, by an intuitive Knowledge, perceive to be what it is, and to be different from any other.

[[E4.3.15]]:547
 > As to incompatibility or repugnancy to co-existence, we may know, that any Subject can have of each sort of primary Qualities, but one particular at once, v.g. each particular Extension, Figure, number of Parts, Motion, excludes all other of each kind. The like also is certain of all sensible Ideas peculiar to each Sense; for whatever of each kind is ***present*** in any Subject, excludes all other of that sort; v.g. no one Subject can have two Smells, or two Colours, at the same time. To this, perhaps, will be said, has not an Opall, or the infusion of Lignum Nephriticum, two Colours at the same time?

[[E4.3.21]]:553
 > As to the fourth sort of our Knowledge, viz. of the real,  
 > actual, Existence of Things, we have an intuitive Knowledge of our own Existence; a demonstrative Knowledge of the Existence of a God; of the Existence of any thing else, we have no other but a sensitive Knowledge, which extends not beyond the Objects ***present*** to our Senses.

 > Our Knowledge being so narrow, as I have shew'd, it will,

[[E4.6.9]]:567
 > Indeed, wrong Names in moral Discourses, breed usually more disorder, because they are not so easily rectified, as in Mathematicks, where the Figure once drawn and seen, makes the Name useless and of no force. For what need of a Sign, when the Thing signified is ***present*** and in view?

[[E4.7.4]]:592-3
 > And therefore where-ever the mind with attention considers any proposition, so as to perceive the two Ideas, signified by the terms and affirmed or denyed one of the other, to be the same or different; it is ***present***ly and infallibly certain of the truth of such a proposition, and this equally whether these propositions be in terms standing for more general Ideas or such as are less so, v.g. whether the general Idea of Being be affirmed of it self, as in this proposition whatsoever is, is; or a more particular Idea be affirmed of it self, as a man is a man, or whatsoever is white is white.
 > 
 > The difference of the Ideas as soon as the Terms are understood, makes the truth of the proposition ***present***ly visible, and that with an equal certainty and easiness in the less as well as the more general propositions, and all for the same reason, viz. Because the mind perceives in any Ideas, that it has the same Idea to be the same with it self;

 > But this Knowledge extends as far as the ***present*** Testimony of our Senses, employ'd about particular Objects, that do then affect them, and no farther.

 > And therefore, as far as Men's Senses are conversant about external Objects, the Mind cannot but receive those Ideas, which are ***present***ed by them, and be informed of the Existence of Things without:

 > Since therefore it is unavoidable to the greatest part of Men,  
 > if not all, to have several Opinions, without certain and indubitable Proofs of their Truths; and it carries too great an imputation of ignorance, lightness, or folly, for Men to quit and renounce their former Tenets, ***present***ly upon the offer of an Argument, which they cannot immediately answer, and shew the insufficiency of

 > Thirdly, The Third Branch may be called σημειωτική‎, or the Doctrine of Signs, the most usual whereof being Words, it is aptly enough termed also λογική‎, Logick; the business whereof, is to consider the Nature of Signs, the Mind makes use of for the understanding of Things, or conveying its Knowledge to others. For since the Things, the Mind contemplates, are none of them, besides it self, ***present*** to the Understanding, 'tis necessary that something else, as a Sign or Representation of the thing it considers, should be ***present*** to it
