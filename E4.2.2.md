> The next degree of Knowledge is, where the Mind perceives the Agreement or Disagreement of any Ideas, but not immediately.

> Yet it does not always happen, that the Mind sees that Agreement or Disagreement, which there is between them, even where it is discoverable;

> 心がつねに現前においてふたつの観念の一致と不一致を知覚できるわけではない理由は、その一致と不一致にかんして探求が行われるそれらの観念は、心によって、それを示すように置かれることができないためである。
> The Reason why the Mind cannot always perceive presently the Agreement or Disagreement of two Ideas is, because those Ideas, concerning whose Agreement or Disagreement the Enquiry is made, cannot by the Mind be so put together, as to shew it.

> この場合では〔…〕
> In this Case then, when the Mind cannot so bring its Ideas together, as by their immediate Comparison, and as it were Juxta-position, or application one to another, to perceive their Agreement or Disagreement,

> 
> Thus the Mind being willing to know the Agreement or Disagreement in bigness, between the three Angles of a Triangle, and two right ones, cannot by an immediate view and comparing them, do it: Because the three Angles of a Triangle cannot be brought at once, and be compared with any other one, or two Angles; and so of this the Mind has no immediate, no intuitive Knowledge. In this Case the Mind is fain to find out some other Angles, to which the three Angles of a Triangle have an Equality; and finding those equal to two right ones, comes to know their Equality to two right ones.
