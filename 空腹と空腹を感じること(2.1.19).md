空腹と空腹を感じること(2.1.19)
 [[E2.1.19]]
 [[意識]]せずに、すなわち、みずからが思考していることを知覚せずに[[思考]]することは〔…〕不可解である。そのように語る者は〔…〕ひとがつねに空腹であって、しかし彼はそのことにつねに気づいていないともいうことができる。空腹がまさにその感覚に存する一方、思考はみずからが考えるということを意識していることに存するのだ。〔…〕意識はあるひと自身の心に過ぎゆくものの知覚である。



 
 This, perhaps, would be suspected of Jargon in others. If they say, The Man thinks always, but is not always conscious of it; they may as well say, His Body is extended, without having parts. For 'tis altogether as intelligible to say, that a body is extended without parts, as that any thing [[/ thinks without being conscious of it]], or perceiving, that it does so. They who talk thus, may, with as much reason, if it be necessary to their Hypothesis, say, That a Man is always hungry, but that he does not always feel it: Whereas hunger consists in that very sensation, as thinking consists in being conscious that one thinks. If they say, That a Man is always conscious to himself of thinking; I ask, How they know it? Consciousness is the perception of what passes in a Man's own mind.
