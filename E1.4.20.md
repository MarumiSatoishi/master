[[記憶の特徴からの生得観念論批判(1.4.20)]]


> これに対して、私に次のように付け加えさせてほしい。もしなんらかの生得観念、すなわち、心が**実際には**それについて思考していない観念が存在したとしたら、それらは記憶に格納されていなければならず、それゆえ、思い出しによって視野にもたらされなければならないだろう。つまり、それが以前に心の中の知覚であった〔ことがある〕と思い出されたときに、知られるのでなければならないだろう。〔…〕
> To which let me add: If there be any innate *Ideas*, any *Ideas*, in the mind, which the mind does not [actual]ly think on; they must be lodg'd in the memory, and from thence must be brought into view by Remembrance; i.e. must be known, when they are remembred, to have been perceptions in the mind before, unless Remembrance can be without Remembrance. 
>
> というのは、思い出すことは、ある事物を記憶とともに、あるいはそれがかつて知られていたあるいは知覚されていたことの意識を伴って知覚することであり、これなしには、心に入ってくるすべての観念は、新しいものであり、思い出されたものではないからだ。
> For to remember is to perceive any thing with memory, or with a consciousness, that it was known or perceived before: without this, whatever *Idea* comes into the mind is new, and not remembred: 
> この以前心のうちにあったという意識が、思い出しを他のすべての思考の方法と区別するものだからである。
> This consciousness of its having been in the mind before, being that, which distinguishes Remembring from all other ways of Thinking. 
>

> Whatever *Idea* was never perceived by the mind, was never in the mind. Whatever Idea is in the mind, is either an [actual] perception, or else having been an [actual] perception, is so in the mind, that by the memory it can be made an [actual] perception again. Whenever there is the [actual] perception of an *Idea* without memory, the Idea appears perfectly new and unknown before to the Understanding: Whenever the memory brings any *Idea* into [actual] view, it is with a consciousness, that it had been there before, and was not wholly a Stranger to the mind. Whether this be not so, I appeal to every ones observation: And then I desire an instance of an Idea, pretended to be innate, which (before any impression of it by ways hereafter to be men tioned) any one could revive and remember as an Idea, he had formerly known; without which consciousness of a former perception there is no remembrance; and whatever Idea comes into the mind without that consciousness is not remembred, or comes not out of the memory, nor can be said to be in the mind before that appearance. For what is not either [actual]ly in view, or in the memory, is in the mind no way at all, and is all one as if it never had been there. Suppose a Child had the use of his Eyes till he knows and distinguishes Colours; but then Cataracts shut the Windows, and he is forty or fifty years perfectly in the dark; and in that time perfectly loses all memory of the *Ideas* of colours, he once had. This was the case of a blind Man I once talked with, who lost his sight by the small Pox when he was a Child, and had no more notion of colours, than one born Blind. I ask whether any one can say this Man had then any *Ideas* of colours in his mind, any more than one born Blind? And I think no body will say, that either of them had in his mind any Idea of colours at all. His cataracts are couch'd, and then he has the *Ideas* (which he remembers not) of colours, de novo, by his restor'd sight, convey'd to his mind, and that without any consciousness of a former acquaintance. And these now he can revive, and call to mind in the dark. In this case all these *Ideas* of colours, which when out of view can be reviv'd with a consciousness of a former acquaintance, being thus in the memory, are said to be in the mind. 
> 
> 〔…〕視野のなかに**現実に**ない観念が、なんであれ心の中にあることは、記憶の中にあることにのみよる。もし記憶の中にもそれがないのだとしたら、それは心の中にないのである。
> The use I make of this is, that whatever *Idea* being not [actual]ly in view, is in the mind, is there only by being in the memory; and if it be not in the memory, it is not in the mind; 
> 
> and if it be in the memory, it cannot by the memory be brought into [actual] view, without a perception that it comes out of the memory, which is this, that it had been known before, and is now remembred. If therefore there be any innate *Ideas*, they must be in the memory, or else no where in the mind; and if they be in the memory, they can be reviv'd without any impression from without, and whenever they are brought into the mind, they are remembred, i.e. they bring with them a perception of their not being wholly new to it. This being a constant, and distinguishing difference between what is, and what is not in the memory, or in the mind; that what is not in the memory, whenever it appears there, appears perfectly new, and unknown before; and what is in the memory, or in the mind, whenever it is suggested by the memory, appears not to be new, but the mind finds it in it self, and knows it was there before. By this it may be tried, whether there be any innate *Ideas* in the mind before impression from Sensation or Reflection. I would fain meet with the Man, who when he came to the use of reason, or at any other time remembred any of them: And to whom, after he was born, they were never new. If any one will say, there are *Ideas* in the mind, that are not in the memory; I desire him to explain himself, and 25 make what he says intelligible.
