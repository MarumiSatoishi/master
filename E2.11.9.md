[[2.11 識別、およびその他の心のはたらきについて]]＞[[抽象]]

The use of Words then being to stand as outward Marks of our internal Ideas, and those Ideas being taken from particular things, if every particular Idea that we take in, should have a distinct Name, Names must be endless. 

これを防ぐために、心は個別の対象から受け取られた[[個別観念|個別の観念]]を、一般的なものにする。これはそれ〔個別の観念〕を、心のうちに、他のすべての実在、ならびに時点、場所、あるいは他のあらゆる随伴観念といった現実存在の状況から分離した仕方での[[顕れる|顕れ]]として[[考慮]]することによってなされる。これは**抽象**と呼ばれる。これによって、個別の存在者から取られた**観念**が、同じ種類のすべてのものの一般的な代表となる。
To prevent this, the Mind makes the particular Ideas, received from particular Objects, to become general; which is done by considering them as they are in the Mind such Appearances, separate from all other Existences, and the circumstances of real Existence, as Time, Place, or any other concomitant *Ideas*. This is called *ABSTRACTION*, whereby *Ideas* taken from particular Beings, become general Representatives of all of the same kind; 

and their Names general Names, applicable to whatever exists conformable to such abstract *Ideas*. Such precise, naked Appearances in the Mind, without considering, how, whence, or with what others they came there, the Understanding lays up (with Names commonly annexed to them) as the Standards to rank real Existences into sorts, as they agree with these Patterns, and to *denominate* them accordingly. Thus the same Colour being observed to day in Chalk or Snow, which the Mind yesterday received from Milk, it considers that Appearance alone, makes it a representative of all of that kind; and having given it the name Whiteness, it by that sound signifies the same quality wheresoever to be imagin'd or met with; and thus Universals, whether Ideas or Terms, are made.
